# IPFS CIDs Owners

Command-line tool for uploading a file to IPFS and stores the CID in a smart contract, built in
Rust as an example.

## Repository structure

Directories:

- _smart-contracts_: Solidity smart contracts that the application interact with. The directory is a
  [Truffle](https://trufflesuite.com/docs/truffle/) project.
- _contract-bindings_: Rust bindings for the contracts in the _smart-contracts_ directory. They
  auto-generated by [ethers](https://crates.io/crates/ethers) crate.
- _cli_: The command-line tool implemented with Rust.

Files in the root of the repository out of the usual ones:

- _Cargo.toml_: This cargo only defines a Cargo workspace to gather the different crates present in
  this repository.
- _docker-compose.yaml_: Defines a set of services that run in Docker needed for development and
  testing purposes.
- _Makefile_: Define a set of recipes to conduct several development, testing, and build purposes
  for not having to document (in this README) nor remembering what's needed for executing each one.

  Execute `make` or `make help` to see the list of public recipes with a brief description of each
  one of them
